# T3 upstream review log

This ledger is the durable handoff between upstream-review sessions. The `reviewed-through` commit is the newest upstream commit for which every candidate has received a user decision. Do not advance it for a partial review.

Deferred decisions remain listed after the cursor advances so later sessions can revisit them without rediscovering the entire upstream range.

## Review batches

No upstream review batches have been completed yet.

For each completed batch, append a section in this form:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — `<previous-cursor>..<reviewed-head>`

| Change set | Upstream      | Decision                      | Pylon reference        | Rationale or revisit condition |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| A1         | `sha` / `#pr` | adopted, skipped, or deferred | branch, commit, or `—` | concise reason                 |
```
