# Unused code audits

`vp run knip:check` checks unused files and dependencies across the repo, then
unused runtime exports in `apps/desktop`, `apps/web`, and every internal package under
`packages/`. CI enforces both checks.
Exported types and Effect schemas are allowed without consumers. The schema preprocessor
recognizes schema types, including aliases and schema classes; functions that create or decode
schemas remain checked. Completely unused files remain checked too.
Named exports in web UI component modules are kept as complete component sets. Knip ignores
unused exports in `apps/web/src/components/ui/*.tsx`, while still reporting an entire unused file.
Use `vp run knip --workspace apps/web` to audit one workspace, including exports,
or `vp run knip:production --workspace apps/web` to find code kept alive only by tests.
The full export audit still has findings and is not a repo-wide CI gate. Extend the
export check's workspace selectors as more workspaces become clean. Review callers before
deleting code; production mode can also report development scripts and test fixtures.
Runtime-discovered entrypoints and dependency exceptions belong in [knip.jsonc](../../knip.jsonc).

Local verification stays scoped to the changed workspace. CI owns the repository-wide gate.
Review runtime-discovered entrypoints against Pylon’s packaged server, Prime, Electron, and native-client launch paths before removing a reported file.
