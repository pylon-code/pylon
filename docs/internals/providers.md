# Provider architecture

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

A provider is the agent runtime that does the actual work. T3 Code supports several, and the
orchestration layer does not know which one is behind a thread.

## Built-in drivers

[`builtInDrivers.ts`][drivers] exports `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS` with six entries:

| Driver kind   | Driver source                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `codex`       | [`Drivers/CodexDriver.ts`][codex]       |
| `claudeAgent` | [`Drivers/ClaudeDriver.ts`][claude]     |
| `cursor`      | [`Drivers/CursorDriver.ts`][cursor]     |
| `grok`        | [`Drivers/GrokDriver.ts`][grok]         |
| `opencode`    | [`Drivers/OpenCodeDriver.ts`][opencode] |
| `primeAgent`  | [`Drivers/PrimeAgentDriver.ts`][prime]  |

Each driver declares its `driverKind`, a `configSchema`, and a `create` function that builds an
adapter in a child scope. Adapter implementations live beside them in
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/` (`CodexAdapter.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.ts`, and so on) and conform to
[`ProviderAdapter.ts`][adapter]. Read the driver plus its adapter to see how a specific agent's
transport, config, and event shapes are mapped.

Prime Agent uses its public detached-daemon APIs as the primary runtime. One scoped daemon belongs
to a provider instance, while each Pylon thread owns an isolated, deterministic native session
directory. The client-visible continuation cursor stays an opaque marker; a server-private sidecar
binds it to the exact stable Prime transcript identity and verifies the saved file before cold
resume. On POSIX filesystems the thread session directory is owner-only, and its identity,
managed-extension, and native transcript files are protected before the session becomes usable. Prime-native events terminate in
`provider/prime/*` and map to provider-neutral runtime contracts; daemon identifiers, sockets,
paths, request IDs, and native payloads never cross the provider boundary.

A short-lived RPC probe discovers the qualified model catalog. Its synthetic `default` model means
“do not force a model,” while discovered model metadata drives generic thinking and service-tier
composer options. The daemon adapter can switch models before a turn, steer an active turn, and
keeps queued native runs inside one Pylon turn until the queue settles. Approval-required sessions
materialize a server-owned, token-correlated Prime extension, disable extension discovery, verify
the generated source plus the loaded extension-sourced marker through public resource APIs, set and
verify RLM depth zero before prompt admission, reject slash-command prompts that bypass tool hooks,
and disable unverified daemon recovery so transport loss requires a fresh verified session. Its
blocking hooks map reviewable built-in edit, shell, and IPython requests privately to canonical
Pylon approval events; unknown tools and oversized inputs are denied rather than incompletely
presented. Native request IDs and policy tokens remain adapter-local. The gate fails closed, but it
is not an OS sandbox, so approved IPython and shell calls retain host access. ACP remains an explicit
compatibility fallback for custom launch arguments or failed daemon setup. The fallback snapshot
strips daemon-only model options and capabilities rather than rendering controls ACP would ignore.

## Registry and routing

Two registries separate configuration from live processes:

- [`ProviderInstanceRegistry`][instances] keys configured instances by `ProviderInstanceId`. Creating
  one looks up the driver by `driverKind`, decodes `entry.config` with that driver's schema, opens a
  child scope, and calls `driver.create`.
- [`ProviderAdapterRegistry`][registry] resolves an instance ID to its live adapter via
  `getByInstance`.

[`ProviderService`][service] sits on top. It combines the adapter registry with the provider session
directory to route session and turn operations for a thread, so callers name a thread, not an agent.

Adding a driver means writing the driver plus adapter and adding it to `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS`. No
orchestration, contract, or client change is required for the common case.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, and `thread.session.stop`, plus the mode
setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and `thread.interaction-mode.set`.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.
