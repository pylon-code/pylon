# Connection runtime

Web, the desktop renderer, and mobile share one connection owner per environment
in `packages/client-runtime`. Platform code supplies storage, credentials, network
signals, and application lifecycle events. React views consume the runtime.
Keeping retries and session lifetime here prevents competing reconnect loops when
several views need the same environment.

## One retry owner

The [supervisor](../../packages/client-runtime/src/connection/supervisor.ts) owns
retry policy; resolving an endpoint and opening an RPC session are single
attempts. Transient failures retry with jittered exponential backoff, capped at
five minutes, that resets only after a connection stays up. Without jitter, every
client of a restarted server reconnects in the same second; with a short cap, a
client that can never connect retries all day. Offline states and authentication
failures wait for a wakeup instead of spending attempts on unchanged conditions.

Foregrounding, an explicit retry, and an offline report probe the established
session, and only a failed probe reconnects. Offline reports are often wrong, for
example for a loopback server. A long mobile background suspension is the one
exception: it replaces the session at once, because the OS can kill a socket
without reporting closure, and a probe would hold a dead socket in "Resuming"
until it times out. That fresh attempt runs even while the network reports
offline. Foregrounding also wakes a pending retry immediately and
leaves an ordinary in-flight attempt alone.

The [registry](../../packages/client-runtime/src/connection/registry.ts) scopes
connections by environment. An involuntary disconnect retains the registration
and cached data. Explicit removal closes the scope and clears credentials,
projections, and platform-owned state such as drafts. Cloud-account changes apply
to relay registrations; they must not discard directly paired environments.

## HTTP authorization

RPC sessions authenticate at socket upgrade, while HTTP snapshot loaders need current
credentials from the shared
[authorization service](../../packages/client-runtime/src/authorization/service.ts).
Each request resolves its credential and endpoint when it runs, renews near expiry,
and retries a rejected credential once. Renewal is shared per environment and bounded
to 30 seconds, and the request deadline includes that time. Cloud-account or
signing-key changes prevent a stale credential from being reused or persisted, and
removing an environment prevents a late renewal from restoring its saved token.

Replacing a healthy socket for HTTP renewal would interrupt conversations and change
the transport generation without a transport failure. Credential expiry therefore
does not close the socket, and refresh failure belongs to the HTTP operation. Session
listings retain unrevoked connected sessions after expiry so an open connection does
not disappear from access management. This does not extend the credential's lifetime:
new HTTP requests and socket upgrades still require valid credentials.

## Transport health and data freshness are separate

A socket opening is insufficient evidence that the environment is usable. An
[RPC session](../../packages/client-runtime/src/rpc/session.ts) exposes `client`,
`initialConfig`, `subscribeServerConfig`, `ready`, `probe`, and `closed`, and makes
one attempt without retrying. It opens one shared server-config stream:
`initialConfig` is that stream's first snapshot, `ready` waits for it, and
`subscribeServerConfig` with the session's input joins the stream with a replay of
current state instead of opening another subscription. `closed` fires when the socket
disconnects and also when that config stream ends or fails. Shell and thread data then
have their own synchronization state. A failed shell subscription can coexist
with a healthy connection; labeling that state "reconnecting" promises a
transport retry that will never happen.

Cached projections remain readable offline. They must neither imply a live
connection nor overwrite newer live data during a reconnect. Loading and
resuming snapshots belongs to the shared state services, so every view agrees
on which data is current.

[Thread detail](../../packages/client-runtime/src/state/threads.ts) separates
subscription lifetime from cache lifetime. Mounted consumers share one live
stream, which stops when the last consumer unmounts; hidden mounted routes still
count. A registry-local cache retains state and its replay cursor for five idle
minutes so back navigation can resume without another snapshot download.

Retain state and cursor together only after an update finishes. Cancellation must
not advance the cached cursor beyond the applied data, and an old scope must not
overwrite its successor's cache. Preserve pagination data on reuse, but clear
canceled loading state.

The [RPC boundary](../../packages/client-runtime/src/rpc/client.ts) resolves
requests against the current session at execution time. Durable subscriptions
follow replacement sessions. After a transport failure they wait for the
supervisor; an expected domain failure may resubscribe on the same healthy
session. Reconnection does not automatically replay mutations, whose retry and
idempotency rules belong to the operation.
