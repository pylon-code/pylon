# Settings and project overrides

The Settings breadcrumb ends with the environment and project a change applies to. They start
at **All environments** and **All projects** and stay selected as you move between categories or
search for a setting.

Preferences saved on this device, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored on a server. Choose one environment to
edit its settings, or leave **All environments** to edit every connected environment at once.
Offline environments keep their current values; this is a bulk edit, not a synced global default.

Choose a project to override settings for it on the selected environments. A layers icon beside
each server row's title shows where the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment,
or a project override. Click it to see that chain on every selected environment. An override can
be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a project are shown read-only
while a project is selected.

When the selected environments disagree, the control shows **Mixed** in place of a value and the
layers icon turns amber. Picking a value applies it to every selected environment.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

Providers and diagnostics are per machine: they show one environment at a time, the primary
one until you pick another. Every other setting fans out to the selection.

On mobile, open **Settings** and use the filter in its header to choose connected environments
and a project. The filter stays available in server-setting pages. With **All projects** selected,
the **Server settings** categories and auto-settle controls in **Thread behavior** edit the
selected environments' defaults. Choosing a project edits its overrides on the selected
environments. Use **Use defaults** in a page to remove that page's project overrides.
Open **Settings → Projects & threads → Overview** to rename the project across its selected
connected checkouts and see where those checkouts live.
Settings that are environment-wide stay read-only while a project is selected. When selected
targets disagree, a control shows **Mixed** until you choose one value. Appearance, keyboard,
and other phone-only settings ignore the filter.

## Worktree branch names

In **Settings → Source Control → Worktree branch naming**, choose a static prefix,
a model-selected semantic prefix such as `feat/` or `fix/`, or custom instructions
for the complete name. The static prefix defaults to `t3code/`; a trailing slash is
optional, and an empty prefix adds nothing. Invalid characters in a static prefix
are replaced with hyphens. Custom instructions are appended to
the naming prompt and can specify issue IDs, namespaces, and casing.

These settings apply to automatically named new worktree branches. Select a project
to override its environment defaults. Worktree directories keep their original names.
If generation fails, or a custom name is invalid or already taken, the temporary
branch name remains.

## Scheduled tasks on mobile

Open **Settings → Scheduled tasks** to create recurring tasks or manage existing
ones across your connected environments. Use the settings filter to narrow the
list by environment or project. Each task runs on the environment you choose,
using its project, model, and workspace settings. Fixed-time schedules use that
environment's time zone, which may differ from your phone's.

You can edit, pause, resume, run immediately, or delete a task from the list.
Leaving an edited form asks before discarding unsaved changes.

## Defaults and inheritance

General contains the model and workspace for new threads. Integrations controls agent browser
access. Source Control contains automatic pull, the default pull request merge method and text
generation. The same rows edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the
project crumb.

The Project category, shown while a project is selected, holds the project's name, icon, actions,
checkouts and removal. Actions belong to a project: editing them creates the project's own list
on each selected environment, and reset returns to the environment's shared list. A project's
`t3.json` actions can be imported there.

For workspace mode, a project's `t3.json` preference applies when the project has no override.
For new worktrees, choose whether git initializes submodules recursively, only at the top level,
or not at all. A project override takes precedence over its environment setting; when neither
is set, `worktreeSubmodules` in the newly checked out branch's `t3.json` applies, otherwise
initialization is recursive. This does not change existing worktrees.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Project to choose an icon, emoji, custom one- or two-character monogram,
or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
Pylon detect an icon again.

Icon and image choices apply to the selected checkouts in a project group and appear on connected
clients. Every environment in the group must support saved icons before custom icons are available.
The monogram option appears only when every environment in the group supports it.
Pylon supports SVG, PNG, ICO, JPEG, GIF, AVIF, and WebP images. Custom icons and emoji show on web and
desktop; mobile shows saved emoji and custom monograms, and shows a colored project-title initial
for Lucide icons. Without a saved choice, mobile uses the project's image when one is available.
Mobile **Client storage** includes
cached project images and can clear them.

When no custom icon or image is found, web and desktop show a two-character monogram with colors
derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.

## Keep the default branch current

In Source Control, enable **Automatically pull** to keep the default-branch checkout up to date
with its configured upstream. Choose an environment to set the default or a project to override it.

Pylon checks in the background and when the server starts. It only pulls when it can fast-forward
and the checkout has no changed files, untracked files, or local commits. It skips checkouts on
another branch or without an upstream. If a checkout has local work, resolve it yourself before
automatic pulls can resume.
